the lang="" attribute is to specify in which language we want to display the website content.
Charset is used to specify which charset are we supporting in the web page. By default "utf-8" is the charset which will supoort all languages and it is the most popular one. There are other charset also which will support different languages such as ISO-8859-1 (supports only english) won't show characters properly from other languages. 
For representing the contents in multiple devices such as desktop, phone, tablets we are writing this command "<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">". we can also control zooming options here. 
<title></title> tag is to name the tab name.
<script></script> tag is to write the js code, we can directly write the inline code or we can seperate file. While writing in separate file we are suppose to use src attribute to specify the relative path(name inclusive) of the file.
<link></link> tag is to write css code and link that to html file. And we use rel(relation) attribute to specify the type of the file being link. href attribute is used to specify the relative path.  
 If we want to write the css code in html file then we can write it using <style></style> tag

Relative path
relative path is nothing but it's a path from one file to another file. 
we can navigate to files from both farword and backward navigation.  

 Directories are structured like Trees.
 Root - 17, beginner
 beginner - scripts folder, index.html, script.js, style.css, keyPoints.txt
 scripts - index.js

 ../../02 - modal/test.txt

 Relative Path:
 File A trying to navigate a path to File B.

 ./ - Forward Navigation(in the sibling, child directories)

 ../ - Backward Navigation(One level above, partent directores)
